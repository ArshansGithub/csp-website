        <h1>Snake Game (1.1.9 Project)</h1>
        <img src="images/1.1.9project.png" width="100" height="100"> 
        <ul>
          <li>Snake inspired snake game</li>
          <li>Contains interactable game elements such as a river, teleporter, and apples</li>
          <li>Each time the game is played, the map is randomly generated with random position and amount of elements</li>
          <li>Each time an apple is eaten, the "snake" gets faster and a "rocket" is spawned that follows the snake.</li>
          <li>If the snake hits the rocket then it dies.</li>
          <li>The game ends if the turtle exits the window boundaries or hits the water.</li>
          <li>If the snake hits a teleporter, it is teleported to a random teleporter on the map.</li>
          <li>Emotion of "snake" also changes based on distance from the nearest rocket. The closer it is, the more worried it gets.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Developed and finished under roughly 2 days</li>
          <li>A fish appears in a random position on the map</li>
          <li>When the fish is clicked/hit a score is determined for that specific fish</li>
          <li>The faster the fish clicks, the more points are awarded. The farther the fish is, the more points awarded</li>
          <li>Visually pleasing main menu is provided with working leaderboard</li>
          <li>Once 5 leaderboard positions are filled, sorting of scores begins from that point on</li>
          <li>Click events are used. User input is requested for the user's name</li>

        <ul>
          <li>The goal of the game is to collect as much cheese as possible without the cat getting you</li>
          <li>As the mouse (the player) you can go through walls and teleport to the opposite one, similar to holes in walls with mice</li>
          <li>Different difficulties and maps in the game adjust the gameplay style</li>
          <li>Eating cheese increases the speed of the cat</li>

        <img src="images/fishtank.png" width="100" height="100"> 
        <ul>
          <li>In this project, we were tasked with finding bugs and errors within a fictitious company's fish tank monitor</li>
          <li>Part of the project was finding possible breach points in email logs</li>
          <li>Other parts of the project include diagnosing/debugging errors with the software and then fixing them</li>
          <li>Test cases were also needed to ensure code fixes were accurate</li>
          <li>Below is the presentation link with the full details</li>

        <ul>
          <li>In this project, we were tasked with analysing a simulation within the NetLogo program.</li>
          <li>My partner and I picked an Ant Simulation because it follows a real life system.</li>
          <li>This simulation we picked specific shows how ants act in a colony to forage for food.</li>
          <li>For more details regarding the simulation view the presentation with the button below</li>

        <h1>Rover Data (Project 3.1.6)</h1>
        <img src="images/marsh.jpg" width="100" height="100"> 
        <ul>
          <li>In this project, we were tasked with analysing raw data and converting them to sensor values within a made-up situation/scenario</li>
          <li>After converting the data to graphs, we inferred which graphs correlated to which sensor.</li>
          <li>After multiple changes in conclusions, we narrowed it down to either marshlands or forest.</li>
          <li>We ended with marsh lands because we didn't see any significant spikes in sound that would correlate to the forest.</li>
        </ul>
